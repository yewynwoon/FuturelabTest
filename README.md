# BACKGROUND
This web application contains four models; Education, Experience, Skill and Endorse. The Skill model is related to the Endorse model through a one to many relationship. The endorsing part was added to the application to show an understanding of model relationships. The actual commenting isn't implemented as it was only used to show a concept.
